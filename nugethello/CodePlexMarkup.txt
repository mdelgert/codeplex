*What is NugGet?*

NuGet is a free and open source package manager for the .NET Framework. NuGet was formerly known as NuPack; the name was changed to avoid confusion with an existing software package called NUPACK. NuGet is distributed as a Visual Studio extension, integrated with SharpDevelop, and included in the C# code snippet tool LINQPad. NuGet can be used from the command line and automated via scripts. NuGet supports native packages written in C++. Since its introduction in 2010, NuGet has evolved into a larger ecosystem of tools and services. [url:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuGet]
